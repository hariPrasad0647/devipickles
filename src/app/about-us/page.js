          Devi Chicken Pickles was born from a simple but heartfelt idea — bring the comfort 
          of homemade food to people who miss that authentic, spicy, mom-made taste. What 
          started in a small Telangana kitchen has now become a trusted name for lovers of 
          real flavour, pure ingredients, and zero compromise.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Our Story</h2>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          In Telangana homes, chicken pickle isn’t just food — it’s emotion, celebration, 
          and nostalgia. Every batch is made the traditional way, just like it’s been done 
          for generations. Slow-cooked chicken, hand-pounded spices, and pure cold-pressed 
          groundnut oil come together to create a flavour that feels like home in every bite.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          We wanted to share that exact feeling — no shortcuts, no factory-made flavours, 
          no premixes. Just honest ingredients and the patience good food deserves.
        </p>
